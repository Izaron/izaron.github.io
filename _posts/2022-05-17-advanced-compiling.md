Programming books are often disappointing. They are like a pyramid - the most books are describing trivial things
and copy-pasted documentation; books in the middle are more exciting; and books on the top are really cool.

This book, which I read in the last year, is a very rare one.
It describes linkers, loaders, their work in very thorough details (as well as compilers but in a lesser degree).
It has a lot of pictures, format specifications, Linux and Windows commands and so on.

The book is so comprehensive, it describes even how do you do versioning you dynamic libraries! ðŸ¤¯ (this is a very specific task)

I'd like to recommend first few chapters as well as chapters 12 and 13 (for Linux developers).
