Long time ago, some really strange characters encodings were used.

For example, a character encoding for the German language `DIN 66003` was in use from 1974 to 1999. It was created by modifying the ASCII encoding, namely replacing characters `[\]{|}~` with `ÄÖÜäöüß`. It was a cool idea as for those days - look, some unecessary brackets were replaced with actual letters of the alphabet!

In order to make it possible to write C++ code on such encodings, there was an ingenious approach - one can write `<%`, `%>`, `<:`, `:>`, `%:`, `%:%:` instead of `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `#`.


Combining with legal substitutions `&&` -> `and`, `!=` -> `not_eq`, etc., this code will compile:
```c++
int main(int argc, char* argv<::>) 
<%
    // lambda with reference-capture:
    auto greet = <:bitand:>(const char* name)
    <%
        std::cout << "Hello " << name
                  << " from " << argv<:0:> << '\n';
    %>;
 
    if (argc > 1 and argv<:1:> not_eq nullptr) <%
        greet(argv<:1:>);
    %> else <%
        greet("Anon");
    %>
%>
```

To add more fun, C/C++ has "trigraphs" - one can substitute `{` -> `??<`, `[` -> `??(`, and so on.
