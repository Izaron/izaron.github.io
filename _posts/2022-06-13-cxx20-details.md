The C++11 standard was a revolution in the language. It made C++ a new language.

The C++20 standard is the most influental standard since C++11, it has a ton of new features.

The book has 530 (!) pages and describes the new features, therefore the book explains
the difference between C++17 and C++20. Despite the book's size, it is not bloatedðŸš±, everything written there
is important, it has the most detailed explanations and code examples.

It can be feeled that a huge amount of work has been put into the book.
Almost all things are explained better than "on the Internet" (on `cppreference.com` and similar sites).
As for "big" features, their design history and other rare information are described.

The book can be read as a reference book - a chapter at a time.
Some features, unfortunately, are not yet supported normally by compilers (as modules),
or rarely used (as coroutines),
so it's worth remembering that rarely used features are quickly forgotten.
