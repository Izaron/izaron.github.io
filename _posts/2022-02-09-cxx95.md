Welcome everyone! Thank you all who came here to learn something interesting about C++!

In this blog I will write small posts about interesting facts, advices, rare language possibilities, compilers internal implementation.

Every post has its tags, for example:

[#creepy](/tags/creepy) - eerie Standard's rules.

[#compiler](/tags/compiler) - interesting facts about compilers and their internal implementation.

[#advice](/tags/advice) - advices from real life experience, not directly related to C++.

[#madskillz](/tags/madskillz) - miracles of C++ techology.

[#video](/tags/video) - interesting YouTube videos about C++.

And many other tags are presented.
