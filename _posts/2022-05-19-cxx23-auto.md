What it takes to copy an object, especially in templated code?
Taking into account that declaring the `auto` variable is always a copy, one can do this:
```c++
void func(const auto& something) {
    auto copy = something;
    use(copy);
}
```

What if we don't want to declare a new variable but rather copy the object in-place?
Then one can do this (`decay` is needed because the actual type might be a reference type
or might have cv-qualifiers):
```c++
void func(const auto& something) {
    use(std::decay_t<decltype(something)>{copy});
}
```

And what if we think that C++ is not hard enough? Then one can do this since C++23:
```c++
void func(const auto& something) {
    use(auto{copy});
}
```

I learned this from a "C++ Weekly" video:

{% include embed/youtube.html id='5zVQ50LEnuQ' %}

There is a not so convincing feature motivation example in the video.

The comments are more interesting than the video, everyone caught facepalm and asked
"what the problem with the old way of copying", "why don't introduce `std::copy`" and so on.
It's hard to not agree with them.
